# Carbon Copy

Some contacts want you to cc or bcc other people whenever you mail them.
This can be to an alternative email address, or to an assistant, another colleague, or a parent.

## Location Types cc and bcc

When you enable this extension, two new location types are added:
- CC To
- BCC To

Add an unlimited number of cc or bcc email addresses to your contacts.

Every time an email is sent to one or more contacts, CiviCRM will look up if there are cc or bcc address to add to the mailing.

## Token Replacement

Please note that the tokens in your email relate to the primary recipient. A contact included a cc to an email will therefore see the values of the primary recipient.
